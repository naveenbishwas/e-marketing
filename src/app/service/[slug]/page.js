    },
    {
      id: 2,

    },
    {
      id: 4,
      q: `What are the key metrics used to measure performance marketing success? `,
      a: ` In performance marketing, success isn't about how many people just saw your ad — it's about what meaningful actions they took. To measure that, we rely on clear, data-backed metrics that show actual performance.`,
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      q: `What makes Unnity different from other agencies?`,
      a: `Unnity delivers high-impact performance marketing services in India across a wide range of industries. Our expertise spans E-commerce, D2C Fashion, Hospitality, EdTech, Real Estate, SaaS, B2B, and several other sectors.
